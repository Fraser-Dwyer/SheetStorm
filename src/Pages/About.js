      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p className="aboutmep">
        I was recently made redundant so a couple of my beloved bambinos very
        kindly came over to comfort me with wine and samosas (the best cure for
        sadness).
        <br />
        <br />
        It should be no surprise that I took the opportunity to moan (and not
        for the first time) about being burdened by the daily task of recording
        all of our Wordle scores in a spreadsheet.
        <br />
        <br />
        In retaliation to this, it was painfully pointed out that I didn't have
        much else to do to properly fill my massive amount of newfound free time
        other than to continue to log their scores for them.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, after another half box of tissues, the banterous bullying was
        briefly suspended. Shortly after, a moderately wine-drunk Luke came out
        with an even better idea.
        <br />
        <br />
        He proposed that I make a website to allow the responsibility-dodging
        duo to enter their own scores, hence alleviating me from the daily duty
        I had so diligently carried out for almost 2 years prior.
        <br />
        <br />
        So with some procrastination, another bottle of wine (or two), and
        almost a month later, I am delighted to present to you Sheet Storm; Your
        very own Wordle score tracking website. Enjoy!
        <br />
        <br />
        P.S. Stay tuned to see what Redundancy Productions Ltd (TM) comes out
        with next! There's plenty in the pipeline so I'm semi-confident that at
        least one more project will make it to completion
        <br />
