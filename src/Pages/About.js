          After recently being made redundant, I had some extra free time so I
          decided to build a website to solve an issue that I had. The issue
          being manually recording the Wordle scores for a couple of my friends
          every single day.
          <br />
          <br />I had been doing this for almost 2 years and the task had become
          quite burdensome, but now they can enter their own scores through
          Sheet Storm and it will tell us who was the Wordler of the week.
          <br />
          <br />I have another couple projects lined up as well so keep an eye
          out for them!
